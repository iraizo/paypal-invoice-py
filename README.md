# paypal-invoice-py
A few paypal invoice functions made to be better than the offical sdk.

This project is mostly just for me and an collection of functions such as:

- def paypal_generate_invoice_id(authorization: str):
- def paypal_create_invoice(email: str, authorization: str):
- def paypal_get_invoice_status(id: str, authorization: str):
- def paypal_send_invoice(url: str, authorization: str):
